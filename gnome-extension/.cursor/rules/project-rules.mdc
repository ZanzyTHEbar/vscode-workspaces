# Project Rules

ALWAYS UPDATE MEMORY BANK AS YOU WORK. 

ALWAYS CHECK MEMORY BANK STATUS BEFORE STARTING A NEW TASK.

## Project Patterns

### Code Organization
1. All new code should follow the hexagonal architecture pattern

### Naming Conventions
1. Use descriptive, full words for names

### Configuration
1. Use JSON format for configuration files
2. Support environment variable overrides

### Development Workflow
1. Use make commands for common tasks
2. Run make dev for development
3. Use make test for testing
4. Clean with make clean

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for all new code
2. Include integration tests for adapters
3. Use table-driven tests where appropriate
4. Mock external dependencies

## Project Intelligence

### User Preferences
1. Configuration via JSON files
2. Command-line interface primary interaction
3. Minimal manual intervention needed
4. Clear error messages and logging

## Project-Specific Rules

### Code Style
2. Follow TS best practices
3. Document all exported items
4. Keep functions focused and small

### Architecture Rules
1. Maintain clean interface boundaries
2. Use dependency injection
3. Keep core domain pure
4. Abstract external dependencies

### Security Rules
1. Never commit credentials
2. Use environment variables for secrets
3. Validate all external input
4. Use TLS for all API connections

### Performance Rules
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Use connection pooling
3. Cache frequently accessed data
4. Batch operations where possible
